# Semester_Project_DAGOBERT

This project is about the implementation of TURL- which is used to help us annotate tables and get us a better understanding of semantic tables.

There has been a couple of changes in the notebook which has been mentioned "line-by-line"

The data is very large and can be downloaded from the google drive account:

The colab notebook is public :

One of the major changes that have been made compared to the original work is replacing some 'custom made BERT model' which was defined by the authors with the BERT model from hugging face.


Also a couple of libraries are extinct, and we have updated. Follow the notebook in the beginning
